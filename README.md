### Goal : 
To build restaurant recommendor system for restaurants in Cincinnati.

### Approach :
I will be working on two approaches to build recommendor system:

**Knowlege Based Recommendor System** 
Knowledge based recommendors are not the first choice for building restaurant recommendor for Zomato. But since our data was scraped and we do not have individual user rating info and details, we cannot implement collaborative filter which would be the optimal solution for this case.

These recommenders are used for items that are very rarely bought. It is simply impossible to recommend such items based on past purchasing activity or by building a user profile. Take real estate, for instance. Real estate is usually a once-in-a-lifetime purchase for a family. It is not possible to have a history of real estate purchases for existing users to leverage into a collaborative filter, nor is it always feasible to ask a user their real estate purchase history.


This will be a simple recommendor system that will perform the following tasks. Ask the user for her/his preferences of :

* Locality
* Cusinies
* Budget for restaurant

**Content Based Recommendor System**
*Will be updated soon*
